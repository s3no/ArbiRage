# ArbiRage
Python-3.7 Arbitrage Betting calculator

ArbiRage is a Proof of concept I threw together to understand how the Arbitrage betting system works. 

To run the program simply run the:<br>
ArbiRage.py for  GUI Version<br>
ArbiRageCo.py for Text Based Version

For information on how the Arbitrage betting system works. Feel free to watch the youtube video that 
gave me the idea and insparation for this at the following URL: https://youtu.be/TGinzvSDayU

~~A automated version will be released soon and all feedback is greatly appreciated.~~<br>

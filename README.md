# ArbiRage
Python-3.7 Arbitrage Betting calculator

ArbiRage is a Proof of concept I threw together to understand how the Arbitrage betting system works. 

To run the program simply run the:
ArbiRage.py for  GUI Version
ArbiRageCo.py for Text Based Version

~~A automated version will be released soon and all feedback is greatly appreciated.~~
If you win to much and try to cash out, a few websites will ban you for "insider knowledge" with
no option to appeal.
A work around is needed. 

For information on how the Arbitrage betting system works. Feel free to watch the youtube video that 
gave me the idea and insparation for this at the following URL: https://youtu.be/TGinzvSDayU
